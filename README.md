```
yarn install
```

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the application with the following command:
```sh
npm run dev
```


## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
